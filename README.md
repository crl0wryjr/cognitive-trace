# Cognitive Trace

## Overview

Cognitive Trace is a framework for exposing and analyzing the reasoning patterns, strategies, and execution steps that Large Language Models (LLMs) use when responding to prompts. By providing visibility into what is typically a black-box process, this tool enables users to inspect the 'how and why' behind LLM responses, making it an invaluable resource for prompt debugging and optimization.

## What are Scratchpads?

Scratchpads serve as a window into LLM reasoning, displaying the step-by-step thought processes that occur during response generation. Think of them as a debugging tool for AI-generated output - they reveal the intermediate reasoning steps that lead to final answers, particularly in Chain of Thought (CoT) style prompting.

## Key Features

- **Reasoning Transparency**: Visual inspection of LLM decision-making processes
- **Prompt Optimization**: Tools for troubleshooting and improving user prompts
- **Strategy Analysis**: Understanding of different reasoning strategies employed by LLMs
- **Execution Step Tracking**: Detailed view of how LLMs approach complex problems

## Research Background

This work is inspired by extensive research on scratchpads and their role in improving Chain of Thought reasoning in language models. While there is significant academic literature on this topic, this project focuses specifically on practical applications for prompt engineering and troubleshooting.
